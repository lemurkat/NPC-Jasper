# NPC-Jasper
Professor Jasper Thomas is a shy and polite geologist, recently returned to Pelican Town to further pursue his studies to uncover the secrets of the dwarves. Obsessed with his work, and his pursuit for knowledge, can you help him realize that there is more to life?

He currently resides in a newly-added second storey above the Archaeology House - which is also home to a collection of archives (See below for more details)!

He has been tested and planned for compatibility with:
- Karmylla's Immersive Maps.
- Stardew Valley Reimagined 2.
- Miss Coriel's Unique Dating Responses.
- Unique Jealousy Responses.
- My other mods: Mr. Ginger/Ranch Expansion.
- Numerous other NPC mods for festival placement, etc. If you find any instances where he: a, doesn't appear at festivals or b, blocks other NPCs from appearing at festivals, please let me know!

He HAS NOT been fully tested for compatibility for:
- Stardew Valley Expanded

The archives of the Archaeology House also contain many new aspects of SDV lore, some relating to my other mods (Mr. Ginger, the Ranch Expansion). **THIS REQUIRES CP 1.14 or HIGHER to work.** If you do not want extra lore, do not poke through the filing cabinets.

If you run a lore-related mod of your own and would like to add some of your own lore to the archives, please message me and I shall see what can be done. 

Note: sometimes you may see references to a charater named "Mona". This is NOT the custom NPC of the same name, but related to the canon-Mona that once lived in Pelican Town.

There are some aspects of Jasper's six-heart scene that contain a small amount of gore (related to an injury he sustains). A core element of Jasper's character growth relates to a rather terrible thing happening to him during the process of the game, and I will not remove it altogether. Actions have consequences.

Loves:
Jasper, Diamond, Rare Disc.

Likes:
Dwarven artificacts, most Geode Minerals, most Gemstones.

Heart Events:

2 Hearts:  Enter the second storey of the museum when Jasper is in his rooms.

4 Hearts:  Enter Cindersap Forest when Jasper is roaming the forest.

6 Hearts:  Begins on the farmhouse step. Requires seeing the above two heart events first. Comes in multiple parts and takes at least an ingame month to complete. Once begun the next step should be self explanatory. 

8 Hearts:  Enter the Archaeology House after the 6 heart event has fully played out.

10 Hearts:  Jasper will send you a letter in the mail with the details.

NOTES:

** Jasper does not become datable until you have seen his 6-heart event. 

** 14-heart scene not yet written/implemented.

** Some aspects surrounding the 6-heart event have not been 100% tested since last tweaking.

** Marriage Dialogue/8-10 heart dialogue is incomplete.

REQUIRES:
- Content Patcher (1.14 or higher recommended for full implementation)
- TMXL
- Daisy Niko's Tilesheets
