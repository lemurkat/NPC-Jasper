		"Jasper_Peasbody1": "Hello farmer,^We've never met, but I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about our mutual friend, Prof. Jasper Thomas. He's a hot-headed fanatic, and I've heard rumors that he's gone off into the caves following a 'white rabbit' - and, in all likelihood, got himself killed. Despite what I'm sure he's told you (since we parted rather unamicably), I've never wished harm upon him. But then again... he was always a bit of a stubborn fool, and never inclined to leave well alone what should be left alone!^I'm sorry, this isn't a threat! It's merely an expression of concern. Please, if you've found him - alive or dead - I'd appreciate you letting me know. Because we were friends once and, truth be told, I still care for the pig-headed fool.^^Regards, ^Professor Cameron Peasbody.[#]Peasbody's Letter",
		"Jasper_Home": "Greetings @,^I am truly indebted to you. That you would find me, and bring me home. Or what is left of me. The infection has left me a shadow of my former self, and the injury was as dire as I feared... I hope it shall not come as too much as a shock to you, my friend.^^I shall be home tomorrow, into what Gunther has uncharitably labelled \"house arrest\". I suspect I shall achieve a great deal of writing, and possibly some reading too.^^Your company would, as always, be greatly appreciated.^^Best wishes, Jasper.[#]Jasper is home.",	
		"Jasper_Home1": "Dear @.^House arrest is starting to get tiresome. I miss the scent and the sound of the forest. I am becoming more adept with the wheelchair now, but alas it is problematic ascending and descending the stairs - for which Gunther has been very courteous in assisting - and once outside the ground proves treacherous and uneven. I am practicising my exercises every morning and evening, like a dutiful student, in the hope that soon I shall be at least somewhat ambulant once more.^^Yours truly, Jasper.[#]Jasper's correspondence 1.",
		"Jasper_HomeA": "Greetings and salutations!^I hope things are going well for you on the farm, @, and that you are not yet weary of my correspondence. I have precious few friends in this world, and I do not wish to trouble them.^Speaking of friends - may I dare to think? - I penned a missive to Peasbody and received a swift response! It appears, perhaps, that a visit may be imminent.^^Yours fondly, Jasper.[#]Jasper and Peasbody.",
		"Jasper_HomeB": "Hello @!^Apologies for my melancholic mood earlier. I find my outlook much improved, for I have just received excellent news. My wound has healed fully, thus I am to be fitted with a prosthetic. I will become bionic man! Ah, I jest, but it will be good to get back on my own two - well, one - foot again.^Anyway. I trust all is well with you, and maybe hope that one day soon I shall be able to visit your farm once more. For even though the mines may now be denied me, there is still so much of this world left to explore.^^Fare thee well, Jasper.[#]Jasper's Prosthetic.",
		"Jasper_Picnic": "My dear friend,^ I have discovered the most magical place! Please meet me near the statue of 'Old Man Cannoli' over the noon-time period on the next sunny day. You might like to put in your swimwear!^^Fondest regards, Jasper.[*]Invitation to a picnic"
