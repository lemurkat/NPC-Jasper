    "Wed4": "There's a beautiful cat that hangs around outside sometimes.#$b#Maybe one day I'll let him in. Every good library needs a cat, don't you think?",

    "Fri6": "You seem to have settled in better than I have. I feel more comfortable hanging out with the books than the people.",

    "Sun4": "I wasn't sorry to leave Veldt Island. You'd be surprised at how lonely you can feel in a crowded city.#$b#Actually, maybe you wouldn't. You're from Zuzu, right?",
    "Sun2": "Have you met Professor Jasper? Very wise fellow, albeit a tad obsessive.",
	"Fri8_inlaw_Jasper": "How's life with Jasper? I miss having him around, but I'm glad you found your happy ending.#$b#Makes me wonder if some day I'll find my own.#$b#%Gunther stares over your shoulder again, a distant look in his eyes.",
"JasperGone1": "Jasper now's how to take care of himself, but I'm still worried about what might happen to him in those mines.#$b#I offered to go with him, but he insisted that the dwarves would be more likely to show themselves if he went alone.#$b#Stubborn fool... I hope he comes back in one piece.",
"TalkJasperHome": "Jasper's been quiet ever since he came home. I'm not surprised, with what he must've gone through.#$b#He needs friends more than ever, @. I'm glad he has you.",
